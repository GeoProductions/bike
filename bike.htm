RIDING BIKES IN PLACES (DISS TRACK)

(LilSimsie-style petty but funny, like “why do you exist” energy)

[Intro]
Yeah…
It’s another one…
For the weirdest genre on Earth…
Let’s go.

[Verse 1]
Why you riding bikes in places?
Bro you’re in a Tesco aisle, what are you chasin’?
Pedalling past the meal deals like it’s Tour de France,
Mate you nearly clipped a nan, give her half a chance

You rollin’ through a café like “this is content”
No it’s not, it’s just cringe with a bike attachment
Wheelin’ past the tills like you’re doin’ a mission
The only thing you’re delivering is secondhand embarrassment

[Hook]
Riding bikes in places, why?
In a shopping centre, don’t lie
You ain’t cinematic, you ain’t cool
You’re just a guy breakin’ rules

Riding bikes in places, wow
You in the library right now
Put the handlebars away
Go outside like… today.

[Verse 2]
You’ve got GoPro footage of a carpet showroom
Man I promise you, nobody asked for that view
Pedals squeakin’, staff stressin’, customers shook
One wrong move and you’re in the bargain book

“POV: exploring secret locations”
It’s a B&Q mate, calm your imagination
You act like you’re in a stealth game level
But you’re literally dodging paint tins and kettle shelves

And the music’s always like… doof doof doof
Like you’re about to pull up on the roof
But you’re stuck behind a pram and a trolley
Bro you’re not a rebel, you’re mildly annoying

[Hook]
Riding bikes in places, why?
In a shopping centre, don’t lie
You ain’t cinematic, you ain’t cool
You’re just a guy breakin’ rules

Riding bikes in places, wow
You in the library right now
Put the handlebars away
Go outside like… today.

[Bridge]
And if grandma sees you, it’s OVER
She’s calling it wicked behaviour
“Scrap this concept” — straight facts
Get your bike OUT the carpet shop, man, relax

[Final Hook / Outro]
Riding bikes in places, no
Not in IKEA, not in Co-op
Not in a bank, not in a hall
Not in the office, not at all

Riding bikes in places, bruh
That content is a waste of dust
Get a helmet, touch some grass
Before grandma kicks your ass 😭

If you want I can do a more aggressive version or a more UK drill one 💀
